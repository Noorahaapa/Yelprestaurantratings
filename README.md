# Multilinear regression model to predict Yelp rating

To find out, what are the most importat features that impact a restauran's Yelp rating a multilinear regression model is crafted from six data sets provided by Yelp to Codeacademy. 
This document gives more detail to the jupyter notebook that the data is used for processing the data and building of the model. 

## How it works

Yelpratings.ipynb contains all work for extracting data, processing and analysing it to finally trying out models with different sets of features. 
The datasets used for building of the model were provided by Yelp to Codeacademy and are not available for public distribution. 

## Model developed 

Best model with highest R2 score and no non significant variables was a model containing all statistically significant variables in scope of the excercise.
The resulting model was capable of explaining 68% of variance in the data which is on the lower side.  
Significant impact on the model had variable average_review_sentiment that was as a sole variable capable of explaining 61% of variation in the data.
